### Hey, I'm Serhii 👋

I’m a 29-year-old full-stack developer based in the USA, passionate about building **data-driven digital products**, scalable backend systems, and clean, user-centric interfaces.

I specialize in **real-estate analytics platforms** and complex web applications that combine geospatial data, scoring engines, and modern frontend UX.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

* **ScoreNest / HouseFax** — a real-estate intelligence platform that evaluates properties using:

  * Market Quality Score (MQS)
  * Personal Fit Score (PFS)
  * Advanced category-based analytics (safety, lifestyle, value, future growth)

* Building scalable **data pipelines** that transform raw public & private data into actionable insights

* Designing clean, explainable scoring logic instead of black-box ratings

* Developing modern React dashboards to visualize complex property metrics

## ✨ Fun Facts

* Even though I’m a Python developer, every time I use `print()`, a part of me still expects to hear my printer start whirring 😄
* I enjoy turning messy real-world data into structured, meaningful products
